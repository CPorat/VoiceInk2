# Meeting Recording Critical Issues - Task List

Based on the comprehensive code review analysis of VoiceInk meeting recording implementation.

## Relevant Files

- `VoiceInk/Services/SystemAudioCapture.swift` - Core system audio capture service with comprehensive memory safety improvements
- `VoiceInk/Services/SystemAudioCapture-MemorySafety.md` - Comprehensive memory safety documentation and usage guidelines
- `VoiceInk/Services/MeetingRecordingManager.swift` - Main meeting recording coordinator with race conditions and resource leaks
- `VoiceInk/Services/AudioMixer.swift` - Audio mixing service requiring reliability improvements
- `VoiceInk/Services/RecordingFileManager.swift` - File management service for recording cleanup
- `VoiceInkTests/SystemAudioCaptureTests.swift` - Unit tests for SystemAudioCapture with comprehensive memory safety tests
- `VoiceInkTests/MeetingRecordingManagerTests.swift` - Unit tests for MeetingRecordingManager (to be created)
- `VoiceInkTests/AudioMixerTests.swift` - Unit tests for AudioMixer (to be created)

### Notes

- Unit tests should be created alongside fixes to prevent regression
- Use `xcodebuild test` to run Swift unit tests
- Focus on memory safety, thread safety, and resource management
- All fixes should maintain backward compatibility with existing API

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Fix Critical Memory Safety Issues

  - [x] 1.3 Implement proper format description checking using CMSampleBufferGetFormatDescription
  - [x] 1.4 Add comprehensive error handling for invalid audio formats
  - [x] 1.5 Create unit tests for memory safety scenarios including malformed audio data
  - [x] 1.6 Add memory safety documentation and usage guidelines

- [x] 2.0 Eliminate Application Crash Points
  - [x] 2.1 Replace force unwrap of availableContent.displays.first! in SystemAudioCapture.swift:40

  - [x] 4.2 Implement completion-based audio processing using delegates or completion handlers
  - [x] 4.3 Add proper audio file duration detection instead of sleep-based waiting
  - [x] 4.4 Implement robust error handling for audio mixing failures
  - [x] 4.5 Add audio processing progress tracking and status reporting

- [ ] 5.0 Fix Resource Management and Memory Leaks
  - [x] 5.1 Add explicit audioEngine node detachment in MeetingRecordingManager.swift:238-239
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement proper file handle cleanup and resource deallocation
  - [ ] 5.3 Add RAII pattern for audio engine resource management
  - [ ] 5.4 Implement proper cleanup in error scenarios and cancellation paths
  - [ ] 5.5 Add memory leak detection and monitoring in debug builds
